A very simple plugin to rename the "Posts" menu in the admin to "Blog".

== Description ==

**But where's my BLOG??**

In working with new WordPress users, I've often observed that the difference between the Posts and Pages menus is confusing for people at first. For that matter, I sometimes find myself looking for a menu called "Blog" myself.

This plugin is designed to do one very simple thing: rename the "Posts" item in the admin menu to the more self-explanatory "Blog". No configuration, no options, just activate and enjoy.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `blogify-posts-menu.zip` to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure it? =

You don't! You can just activate the plugin and it's ready to go.

= What if I want to add/change/delete/move other menus around? =

There are excellent plugins to do all that, but I wanted to make something to solve a specific problem without any extra overhead.

= Can I Blogify a Multisite? =

Yep. Network-activate to change the menu on all sites, or leave it up to individual admins.
